Credits
An old law bound the Good and the Evil to keep with at least one rule in their eternal conflict. They shouldn't act directly in the relationship between the living ones, bringing their wills into play trough suggestion and fighting subtly within each soul ...\Selfishness, violence, mercy, love were struggling by toughts, dreams, with varied destinies.\\And yet, one day, the Evil, who couldn't tolerate this equilibrium anymore, chose to break the ancient truce and to incarnate himself into the most vulnerable living beings, and curiously into inanimate objects in some case.\From now on the Evil could reign exclusively onto every being from which he took control.\\Having foreseen this treason, the Good hasn't been taken by surprise. Relinquishing to bypass the law as the Evil did and refusing to sacrifice kind and generous souls, the Good sent some damned and tormented souls which were wishing to make amends to Him ...\Feeling themselves already lost, only they could have the recklesness to fight the dark legion which was rushing into the world.
