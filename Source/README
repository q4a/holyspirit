HolySpirit README FILE

To build the game you will need next 3dparty software

1. SFML v2.0 (development snapshot 9163d04517 from Mar 14, 2012)

1.1 Development files (includes)

1.2 Libraries (static preferred)

To make CMake script automatically find these files add <SMFLDIR> environment path to the system,
which should point to SFML folder with next structure:

<SFMLDIR>
-include
--SFML
---*.*
lib
-*.*

Please note that Cmake script has SFML_STATIC switch set to TRUE. So if it can't find SFML libraries than maybe you want to use
dynamic libraries instead of static. Is this case uncheck that flag. Also read 3dparty\SFML\README file before building the game.

2. dirent.h header if you want to compile under MSVC (http://www.softagalleria.net/dirent.php)

3. Gettext package. You can get it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/gettext/0.14.4/gettext-0.14.4.exe

4. CMake package. http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES:

for MinGW:

1. libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

2. libsndfile-1.dll

3. libstdc++-6.dll

4. mingwm10.dll

Gettext:

libintl3.dll

BUILDING AND RUNNING UNDER LINUX SYSTEMS:

1. As SFML 2.0 wasn't released yet and is not included in your distro repository, so
   you will need to build it yourself before compiling HolySpirit.

To build SFML and run the game you will need to get next packages from your distro repository:

	pthread
	opengl
	xlib
	xrandr
	freetype
	glew
	jpeg
	sndfile
	openal

Don't forget to install the DEVELOPMENT version of these packages

For Ubuntu Linux this will look next(for DEVELOPMENT versions):

	sudo apt-get install libpthread-stubs0-dev
	sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev
	sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
	sudo apt-get install libxrandr-dev
	sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
	sudo apt-get install libglew1.5-dev
	sudo apt-get install libjpeg8-dev
	sudo apt-get install libsndfile1-dev
	sudo apt-get install libopenal-dev
	
Note that there may be more recent versions of libraries. Use them instead.

2. CMake-gui is recommended way to build SFML (and the Game) under Linux. Get it from your distro repo with CMake itself.

3. Configure SFML using CMake-gui. It will report if you dont have any from above dependencies.
   Than build it with preferred IDE or by using "console make". You will need to build ALL SFML libraries.

4. Configure HolySpirit using CMake-gui. It will fail. Uncheck "SFML_STATIC", than set SFML Include Directory and
   SFML libraries pathes using just built SFML files. Click "Configure" again. This time it should work.
   Click "Generate" and than use preferred IDE or just "console make" to build the game. Enjoy ;)

TROUBLESHOOTING

Q: I have set xx_XX language (using Launcher or manually) but game is still in English. I'm using Linux.
A: Maybe your locale is not installed in the system. Use:

	sudo locale-gen xx_XX.UTF-8

to generate it and try again.

Q: Game executable doesn't start. I'm using Linux.
A: Once you download the game, you’ll need to change the permission to allow executing the file as a program.
If you’re not sure how to do this the simplest way is to right-click the file, then click “Properties” followed by the “Permissions” tab.
You’ll find the option to allow execution at the bottom of the window.

Q: Game executable doesn't start. I'm using Linux and i didn't build executable by myself.
A: Try to run the game from console. Go to game folder and type <./Holysprit>. If game gives an error about "can't find shared library"
but you have it than check it's version: seems you need to install another version of that library(e.g. libjpeg6 instead of libjpeg8)
