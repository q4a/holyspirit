HolySpirit README FILE

To build the game you will need next 3dparty software

1. SFML v2.0 (development snapshot 9163d04517 from Mar 14, 2012)

1.1 Development files (includes)

1.2 Libraries (static preferred)

To make CMake script automatically find these files add <SMFLDIR> environment path to the system,
which should point to SFML folder with next structure:

<SFMLDIR>
-include
--SFML
---*.*
lib
-*.*

Please note that Cmake script has SFML_STATIC switch set to TRUE. So if it can't find SFML libraries than maybe you want to use
dynamic libraries instead of static. Is this case uncheck that flag. Also read 3dparty\SFML\README file before building the game.

2. dirent.h header if you want to compile under MSVC (http://www.softagalleria.net/dirent.php)
