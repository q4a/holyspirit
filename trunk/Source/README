HolySpirit README FILE

To build the game you will need next 3dparty software

1. SFML v2.0 (development snapshot 9163d04517 from Mar 14, 2012)

1.1 Development files (includes)

1.2 Libraries (static preferred)

To make CMake script automatically find these files add <SMFLDIR> environment path to the system,
which should point to SFML folder with next structure:

<SFMLDIR>
-include
--SFML
---*.*
lib
-*.*

Please note that Cmake script has SFML_STATIC switch set to TRUE. So if it can't find SFML libraries than maybe you want to use
dynamic libraries instead of static. Is this case uncheck that flag. Also read 3dparty\SFML\README file before building the game.

2. dirent.h header if you want to compile under MSVC (http://www.softagalleria.net/dirent.php)

3. Gettext package. You can get it here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuwin32/files/gettext/0.14.4/gettext-0.14.4.exe

4. CMake package. http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES:

for MinGW:

1. libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll

2. libsndfile-1.dll

3. libstdc++-6.dll

4. mingwm10.dll

Gettext:

libintl3.dll

BUILDING UNDER LINUX SYSTEMS:

1. As SFML 2.0 wasn't released yet and is not included in your distro repository, so
   you will need to build it yourself before compiling HolySpirit.

To build SFML you will need to get next packages from your distro repository:

	pthread
	opengl
	xlib
	xrandr
	freetype
	glew
	jpeg
	sndfile
	openal

Don't forget to install the DEVELOPMENT version of these packages

2. CMake-gui is recommended way to build SFML (and the Game) under Linux. Get it from your distro repo with CMake itself.

3. Configure SFML using CMake-gui. It will report if you dont have any from above dependencies.
   Than build it with preferred IDE or by using "console make". You will need to build ALL SFML libraries.

4. Configure HolySpirit using CMake-gui. It will fail. Uncheck "SFML_STATIC", than set SFML Include Directory and
   SFML libraries pathes using just built SFML files. Click "Configure" again. This time it should work.
   Click "Generate" and than use preferred IDE or just "console make" to build the game. Enjoy ;)
