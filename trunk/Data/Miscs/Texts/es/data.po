At the end of his speech, he invariably threw an acorn on the ground to signify that he had finished, his every action is as a grain of wisdom designed to thrive as the venerable oak.\\A constant friendly smile on the face, He stated the justice of his sweet voice, without ever raising his voice and the good farmers - as their lords - accepted his judgment with these words again and again repeated: \"Just spoke Clodomir the raised finger, he threw the acorn Everything is set!\".\\When the horrific hordes of barbarians beastly manners well known befell Ruhigland, spreading desolation, Clodomir reassured his people: he would talk to these thugs and would surely lambs, because justice is born of love, and it was missing, uneducated poor, the revelation that the values of the Old People to stop doing evil!\\Clodomir then crossed with his usual calm smoldering villages to talk with the barbarians. Meeting one of the leaders of these, named Wilankar Wurgasht he wore a friendly smile and lifted his usual middle finger as a sign of temperance. Las! The other believed he was about to cast a spell, and his sharp sword, cut off in a flash the finger of the holy man, then are arms, and finally his head. His plan is accomplished, the bloodthirsty brute made a pendant Clodomir macabre finger and gave the rest of his body and its reservation of acorns to pigs hungry, bursting into a laugh like the roar of a wild beast."

msgid "This book is an account of the inventory of the relics of the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\\\\\\\\Heart of St. Joachim\\\\The heart of Saint Joachim was found ninety-eight years after his unfortunate death , in a bazaar. He slept in a small wooden box. At the sight of the body withered by years, a particularly devout buyer felt a warmth divine invade, and he called upon God to destroy the field he could not see where the noble body of the saint. As the sentence invoked did not come, the happy man knew he was right and gave the relic to the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\\The heart of St. Joachim is still preserved at St. Clodomir. His condition is correct.\\\\Oreille de Saint Frenegonde\\\\ear of St. Frenegonde was miraculously found one hundred twenty-seven years after his terrible ordeal. Canon Ambroisius was discovered in the stomach of a sow in skinning the animal to make a sausage. Illuminated by divine grace, he immediately recognized the ear as belonging to the saint.\\The ear is preserved in the catacombs of St. Clodomir, in fair condition, though somewhat dry.\\\\\\Eye of Santa Galswintha\\\\The eyes of St. Galswintha appeared in a ceremonial necklace worn by one of the last kings of barbarians Ruhigland. Struck down by a warrior led a holy faith, and the abominable creature freed the precious relic which became property of the abbey.\\Galswintha holy eyes have unfortunately left the catacombs of St. Clodomir following an unfortunate event. A monk of evil memory having judged it expedient to leave the eyes of the Holy shrine for its exhibit at the sight of peasants of his knowledge, the relic disappeared mysteriously. The rumor involves Katrina (suspected of witchcraft) but following the deaths by a sudden illness of three successive investigators recovering the relic has been postponed.\\\\The finger of Saint Clodomir\\\\The mummified finger Saint Clodomir was found in the loot of a barbarian king, who used it as a pen to scribble some incomprehensible gibberish. This use explains the black color of the holy body, which is otherwise in excellent condition."

msgid "To Vlanker brother, honorary monk of the abbey.\\\\As everyone knows the abbey of Saint Clodomir is considered a beacon of faith and imperial heirs of the Old People. Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs, it contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\\Built on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarian rule, the abbey was presented to them as an ignorant vulgar to salting ham. The cult can not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful of the Old courageous people settled in the catacombs and enlarged gradually.\\The underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an act of faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should attempt to venture without a plan).\\Once the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupant. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, and the pure Galswintha course Clodomir.\\One might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Prohibits burial in the crypt of the kings of the capital, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fancier one than the other (we still remember the magician Boris invert the fencing master Gunther paralytic and Ingmar lecherous Minister who obtains the favor of successive Teuderic wife and his daughter Princess Theodora)."
