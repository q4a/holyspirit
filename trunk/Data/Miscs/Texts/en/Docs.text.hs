"Sunday, November 5:\\Abbey apparently is based on huge catacombs containing the relics of four venerable saints. This rental is a huge source of prestige for the Abbey, our good father Hademar has regret in the R block. It seems that some zealous monks, eager to pray with Saints got lost in the maze and never resurfaced.\We therefore got access to a tiny part of the catacombs: two rooms equipped with cells for prayer and rest and in a library. The rest is strongly condemned by a heavy door that is forbidden to touch.\\Tuesday, November 7:\\The cells arranged in order of the Father Hademar in these ancient catacombs offer an ideal place for meditation. The darkness, the silence is such that the monk is totally receptive to subtle signs of Very Large, sometimes seems someone whispers something near his ear.\\Friday, November 10:\\I must admit that sometimes my mind, in this delicious silence, seems to play tricks with me. A bit like a corpse showa in the distance, the deep silence of the cells gives rise of sound illusions, sometimes troubling when consider they emanate actually from the depths of our soul.\\Sunday November 13:\\After the celebration of the Sunday service I spent a few hours reading in the library near the catacombs. Leaving the door open because I was alone, I heard, this time I'm sure, strange and disturbing sounds, like alternating moans of expression of pain and the obscene pleasure. Believing been a subject of a joke of Lothair, a brother who loves to distract us beyond reason, I have traveled the corridor hoping to uncover him, in vain... Noises quickly stopped.\\Monday, November 14:\\I just heard strange noises again nearest to the catacombs, and now I know where they come from: the other side of the forbidden door! Certainly there are creatures on the other side. Tormented souls seeking rest, maybe even, who knows, monks who eventually lost find their way, miraculously surviving in the catacombs for years? I know that Our Almighty knows we be challenged by the most incredible wonders!\Despite the ban of Hademar I will go there tomorrow. Whether men or spirits are there they should be benevolent entities because are based in places of not one but four Saints!"
Holy Frenegonde was a sensitive and creative young woman, who liked to play the penny whistle in green meadows in her childhood. With exquisite beauty, she was in the prime of life when the legions of filthy barbarians poured on our good earth Ruhigland.\Haksil Wurgasht, one of the powerful chiefs of these tribes, arrived one day with a small band of barbarians very excited by the idea of shedding blood and burning villages.\Foreseeing the catastrophe to come near her modest village of Pilunder, Frenegonde, basking in the glory of martyrs, fell on knees near the feet of Haksil, offering him tribute in her mouth to save the village.\The Barbarian, surprised by this unexpected reception, first took her face with his powerful hands, then grabbed her by the ears, according to what was typical for barbarians.\Things were going well and the atmosphere relaxed subtly, when a lieutenant Haksil, very ugly and deformed, had an access of jealousy and with his heavy club struck the skull of unfortunate Frenegonde.\Bacause the brutality of the coup Frenegonde's skull exploded and ears of the unfortunate were left in hands of Haksil. The male member of the latter remained near the mouth of the Saint, because the teeth of the unfortunate remained closed tight near his death.\To expiate his fault, angry Lieutenant makes triple removal of his member and her ears.
Joachim was a shepherd who spoke a little. He led an austere life, retired to the mountains and never went with battle on his congeners. Many took him for a fool and had against him greatest contempt... His only good, except an animal skin and a few sheeps, was a strong shepherd's staff which fanned gossip of jealousy (that detail from life of Joachim, however, remains obscure).\When the barbarians who were ruining Ruhigland penetrated in our sweet country, the people flowed loosely, leaving the weak and the innocent. Joachim was to be part of the batch of victims.\The barbarians, led by the formidable Haksil Shortcut, gave away women, children and the remaining animals, probably by engaging cannibalism (in all likelihood more greedy than rituals).\There was found a heart of adult human, we considered its size as that of Joachim. Certainly the whole village was worth a martyr canonization in good and due form, but the merit of Joachim's nearest relative with congeners was to have left something to be a relic for posterity.
Galswintha was already known from her youth for the purity of her thoughts. Her extreme modesty made her look away even when innocent animals were mating at proximity. Her only pleasure was embroidery, she performed it with a proven talent for miles...\She must have known the torment that would ensure her fame with the terrible barbarian invasions, when her unfortunate fate made her cross the sinister Haksil Shortcut way, whose virility was diminished by the story Holy Frenegonde which had strengthened the bestial cruelty.\Almost always looking for new distractions to entertain the troops, Haksil made with Galswintha's nearest congeners sordid games with pets from village (games, discussing whose details will cause moral condemnation).\Asked to attend the show by the infamous invaders, who hoped to take part indirectly, thrice holy Galswintha had mutilate her own flesh to escape from her vision. With a gesture of defiance and ignoring any pain, she tore her eyes with her fingers and threw them at her feet, her hollow eyes were weeping with blood in abundance.\Her courageous act was unfortunately not provided to avoid obscene and cruel Haksil games but they can not steal her virtue even if the horrible task entrusted on nearest strong bull.
Saint Clodomir, just between the righteous, is the largest ever known Ruhigland Saint.\Renowned for his wisdom, he was accustomed to lift the middle finger of his right hand in a gesture of appeasement when the inhabitants of the Old People bickered, about a misplaced fence, or about suspiciously disappeared poultry. At the end of his speech, he invariably threw an acorn on the ground to signify that he had finished, his every action was as a grain of wisdom designed to thrive as the venerable oak.\With constant friendly smile on the face, He stated the justice with his sweet voice, without ever raising his voice and the good farmers - as his lords - accepted his judgment with these words again and again repeating: "Clodomir just spoke, he raised finger, he threw the acorn. Everything is set!".\When the horrific hordes of barbarians with well known beastly manners befell Ruhigland, spreading desolation, Clodomir reassured his people: he will talk to these thugs as to surely lambs, because justice is born of love, and it was missing, they are auneducated and poor, need to know the revelation of the Old People to stop doing evil!\Clodomir then crossed with his usual calm smoldering villages to talk with the barbarians. Meeting one of the leaders, named Wilankar Wurgasht, he wore a friendly smile and lifted his usual middle finger as a sign of temperance. Here! The other believed he was about to cast a spell, and his sharp sword, cutted off in a flash the finger of the holy man, then arms, and finally his head. His plan was accomplished, the bloodthirsty brute made a pendant from Clodomir's finger and gave the rest of his body and its reservation of acorns to hungry pigs, bursting into a laugh like the roar of a wild beast.
This book is an account of the inventory of the relics of the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\\\\Heart of Saint Joachim\\The heart of Saint Joachim was found ninety-eight years after his unfortunate death, in a bazaar. He slept in a small wooden box. At the sight at withered by years body, a particularly devout buyer felt a warmth of divine invade, and he called upon God to destroy the field where the noble body of the saint was buried. As the invoked sentence did not come, the happy man knew he was right and gave the relic to the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\The heart of St. Joachim is still preserved at St. Clodomir. Its condition is correct.\\Ear of Saint Frenegonde\\Ear of St. Frenegonde was miraculously found one hundred twenty-seven years after her terrible ordeal. Canon Ambroisius was discovered in the stomach of a sow, which was set to make a sausages. Illuminated by divine grace, the man immediately recognized the ear as belonging to the saint.\The ear is preserved in the catacombs of St. Clodomir, in fair condition, though somewhat dry.\\\Eye of Saint Galswintha\\The eyes of St. Galswintha appeared in a ceremonial necklace worn by one of the last kings of barbarians Ruhigland. Struck down by a warrior, led by holy faith, abominable creature freed the precious relic which became property of the abbey.\Galswintha's holy eyes have unfortunately left the catacombs of St. Clodomir because an unfortunate event. A monk of evil memory have judged expedient to elevate the eyes from the holy shrine for its exhibit at the sight of peasants, and the relic mysteriously disappeared. The rumor involves Katrina (suspected of witchcraft) but following deaths because sudden illness of three successive investigators recovering the relic have postponed searching.\\The finger of Saint Clodomir\\The mummified finger of Saint Clodomir was found in the loot of a barbarian king, who used it as a pen to scribble some incomprehensible gibberish. This use explains the black color of the holy body, which is otherwise in excellent condition.
To Vlanker brother, honorary monk of the abbey.\\As everyone knows the abbey of Saint Clodomir is considered a beacon of faith and imperial heirs of the Old People. Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs. It contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\Built on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarians rule, the abbey was presented to them as an house for salting ham. The cult could not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful and courageous Old People settled in the catacombs and enlarged it gradually.\The underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an Act of Faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should not attempt to venture without a plan).\Once the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and they collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupants. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, the pure Galswintha and of course Clodomir.\One might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Burial in the crypt of the kings was prohibited, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fanciers (we still remember the invert magician Boris, the paralytic fencing master Gunther and lecherous Minister Ingmar who obtained the favor of Teuderic's wife and his daughter Princess Theodora).
*Extrait de l’ouvrage de référence « De la délivrance des malédictions », du Frère Majeur Wolfgang Prikopil :\\... ce qu’il y a de plus cruel, plus encore que de souffrir de son vivant, est d’être poursuivi par la douleur au-delà même de la vie. La vie éternelle, tant espérée des hommes, peut être leur pire supplice lorsque leur corps n’est pas, lui, sous la bénédiction de cette éternité.\Enserrés dans une enveloppe charnelle qui se dégrade, passant par tous les stades de la pourriture, ils assistent impuissants à leur retour au néant, esprits immortels mais toujours attachés à un corps qui se délite.\Le seul secours que l’homme victime d’un tel sort peut espérer est une crémation rapide qui le fera disparaître corps et âme, bien que cette pratique soit jugée habituellement hérétique depuis le concile de Brasadil...
*3 mars : Waldemar nous a envoyé en mission de reconnaissance autour de l’abbaye pour récupérer d’éventuels survivants. L’intention est louable, mais je remarque qu’une fois de plus il s’est désigné pour rester à l’abbaye, bien à l’abri. Ou plutôt, comme il dit, pour « coordonner les systèmes de défense ». Ce qui consiste à dire à Bloodwine de jurer moins et d’ouvrir davantage l’œil.\\5 mars : Nous avons rencontré deux femmes non loin de leur maison isolée dans la forêt. Elles ne paraissaient pas spécialement inquiètes de la situation, ce qui est surprenant, et elles nous ont accueilli très froidement, nous menaçant de nous « faire noircir le bout comme aux autres bâtards» si on faisait un pas de plus dans leur direction. Comme nous n’avons pas d’énergie à perdre inutilement nous avons obtempéré pour chercher des âmes plus conciliantes !\\6 mars : Cette nuit nous avons eu une visite inattendue. Un simple d’esprit, nommé Jacquou, nous a harcelé toute la nuit en hululant de façon angoissante et en faisant clignoter un étrange objet lumineux qui nous donnait la désagréable sensation d’être observés par des yeux maléfiques. Les hommes étaient furieux, au point de vouloir tuer le pauvre imbécile, mais j’ai réussi à les en dissuader. Il avait disparu au petit matin.\\7 mars : Nos recherches sont incroyablement lentes, tant nous avons à faire face à un nombre croissant d’abominations en tous genres. Nous progressons difficilement. Ingmar et Jon ont succombé aux assauts des monstres.\\9 mars : Pour l’instant nous n’avons pas trouvé grand monde de vivant… Et lorsque les gens sont encore là, ils semblent étrangement rétifs à être sauvés,  à croire que cette situation amuse ceux qui ne sont pas encore morts !\\14 mars : Nous avons enfin trouvé des hommes, vivants ! Des villageois réfugiés dans une grotte. Nous sommes certes ravis de leur venir en aide, mais il semble que les environs soient envahis par une terrifiante créature géante, qu’ils nomment le « faucheur » (la créature serait l’incarnation d’une ancienne légende ?), et ses rejetons, plus petits mais aussi très agressifs. Nous n’avons pu voir que les petits, qui sont déjà  difficiles à vaincre. Nous allons rester un ou deux jours de plus pour soigner les blessés et se refaire un moral, puis nous rentrerons directement à l’abbaye.\\15 mars : L’entrée de la grotte est cernée par les rejetons du faucheur, qui ne cessent de piailler de leur voix insupportable. Par moment on dirait qu’ils chantent une sorte d’incantation, comme s’ils appelaient quelqu’un… Nous passons encore une nuit ici, et demain nous retournerons tous à St Clodomir.
