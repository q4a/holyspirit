"Sunday, November 5:\\Abbey apparently based on huge catacombs containing the relics of four venerable saints. If this rental is a huge source of prestige for the Abbey, our good father Hademar has regret in the R block access. It seems that some zealous monks, eager to pray with Saints got lost in the maze and never resurfaced.\We therefore got access to a tiny part of the catacombs: two rooms equipped with cells of prayer and rest and in a library. The rest is strongly condemned by a heavy door that it is forbidden to touch.\\Tuesday, November 7:\\The cells arranged in order of the Father Hademar in these ancient catacombs offer an ideal place for meditation. The darkness, the silence is such that the monk is totally receptive to subtle signs of Very Large sometimes seems whispered something his humble nearest ear.\\Friday, November 10:\\I must admit that sometimes my mind, in this silence delicious, seems to me to play tricks. A bit like a corpse found in length show ends nearest the viewer a discrete movement, the deep silence of the cells gives rise to illusions of sounds, sometimes troubling when consider they emanate actually from the depths of our soul.\\Sunday November 13:\\After the celebration of the Sunday service I spent a few hours reading in the library nearest the catacombs. Leaving the door open because I was alone, I heard, this time I'm sure, sounds strange and disturbing, like moans alternating expression of pain and the pleasure of obscene. Believing be the subject of a joke of Lothair, a brother who loves nearest distract us beyond reason, I have traveled the corridor hoping to uncover, in vain... Noises quickly stopped.\\Monday, November 14:\\I just heard strange noises again nearest to the catacombs, and now I know where they come from: the other side of the forbidden door! Certainly there are creatures on the other side. Of tormented souls seeking rest, even, who knows, monks who eventually lost find their way, miraculously surviving in the catacombs for years? I know that Our Almighty knows we be challenged by the most incredible wonders!\Despite the ban Hademar nearest I will get their meeting tomorrow. Whether men or spirits there can be as benevolent entities are based in places where not one but four Saints!"
Holy Frenegonde was a sensitive and creative young woman, who liked to play the penny whistle in the green meadows of his childhood.

To Vlanker brother, honorary monk of the abbey.\\As everyone knows the abbey of Saint Clodomir is considered a beacon of faith and imperial heirs of the Old People. Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs, it contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\Built on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarian rule, the abbey was presented to them as an ignorant vulgar to salting ham. The cult can not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful of the Old courageous people settled in the catacombs and enlarged gradually.\The underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an act of faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should attempt to venture without a plan).\Once the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupant. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, and the pure Galswintha course Clodomir.\One might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Prohibits burial in the crypt of the kings of the capital, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fancier one than the other (we still remember the magician Boris invert the fencing master Gunther paralytic and Ingmar lecherous Minister who obtains the favor of successive Teuderic wife and his daughter Princess Theodora).
