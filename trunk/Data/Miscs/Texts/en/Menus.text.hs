An old law required has always been the good and evil meet has at least one rule in their eternal conflict. They could not directly intervene in the affairs of living entities, acting only by the subtle suggestion and battling within each soul...\nEgoism, violence, pity, love and clashed in the form of thoughts, of dreams, with varied fates.\n\nBut one day evil, which no longer supported the balance was satisfied with the Good, decided to violate the rule RESPECTED far and achieved this in incarnating directly into most living beings vulnerable to his impulses, and, curiously, in some objects.\nHenceforth evil reign could only be on each of which he took possession of some ordinary objects become demonic.\n\nHaving anticipated this treachery, the Well was not surprised. Renouncing to violate the law as Evil had done and refusing to sacrifice the good and generous souls, he used a few storms and damned spirits who wanted to redeem himself deeply with him...\nconsidering himself already lost, alone unconsciousness would have to address the foul legion that has swept across the world.
