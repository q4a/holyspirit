Pretended soldier deliverer of God and Christ's tomb, you have much killing and sometimes breach the law,\flouting the values in whose name you did bloodshed...\Of course you know how to fight, but your burden is the heaviest and you must accomplish many feats to cover you back!
At least you've never pretended to be virtuous...\Been in the mud, you've dressed up in finery demonic female seductress to infiltrate the highest levels of society.\But even among the princes we can not deny their origins when they are unworthy,\and when your charm was not enough you were able to wield the dagger like poison...
The gunslinger is one of those bounty hunters who counts only his own interests. He does not hesitate to kill innocent people if he should and his contracts are the only limit. And even if another offer seems more interesting to him, he may turn against his boss. Normally destined to hell, he is committed by God to do dirty work.
Religious fanatic par excellence, he could always send any heretic or witch to bonfire. And without further ado, he never had remorse or doubt when having the guilt of his victims. So God decided to fulfill the dream of the inquisitor, that is to let him go in a world overrun by evil, a place where he can let go his madness and sadism without killing any innocent victim.
