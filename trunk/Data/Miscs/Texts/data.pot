He slept in a small wooden box. At the sight of the body withered by years, a particularly devout buyer felt a warmth divine invade, and he called upon God to destroy the field he could not see where the noble body of the saint. As the sentence invoked did not come, the happy man knew he was right and gave the relic to the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\nThe heart of St. Joachim is still preserved at St. Clodomir. His condition is correct.\n\nOreille de Saint Frenegonde\n\near of St. Frenegonde was miraculously found one hundred twenty-seven years after his terrible ordeal. Canon Ambroisius was discovered in the stomach of a sow in skinning the animal to make a sausage. Illuminated by divine grace, he immediately recognized the ear as belonging to the saint.\nThe ear is preserved in the catacombs of St. Clodomir, in fair condition, though somewhat dry.\n\n\nEye of Santa Galswintha\n\nThe eyes of St. Galswintha appeared in a ceremonial necklace worn by one of the last kings of barbarians Ruhigland. Struck down by a warrior led a holy faith, and the abominable creature freed the precious relic which became property of the abbey.\nGalswintha holy eyes have unfortunately left the catacombs of St. Clodomir following an unfortunate event. A monk of evil memory having judged it expedient to leave the eyes of the Holy shrine for its exhibit at the sight of peasants of his knowledge, the relic disappeared mysteriously. The rumor involves Katrina (suspected of witchcraft) but following the deaths by a sudden illness of three successive investigators recovering the relic has been postponed.\n\nThe finger of Saint Clodomir\n\nThe mummified finger Saint Clodomir was found in the loot of a barbarian king, who used it as a pen to scribble some incomprehensible gibberish. This use explains the black color of the holy body, which is otherwise in excellent condition."

msgid "To Vlanker brother, honorary monk of the abbey.\n\nAs everyone knows the abbey of Saint Clodomir is considered a beacon of faith and imperial heirs of the Old People. Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs, it contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\nBuilt on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarian rule, the abbey was presented to them as an ignorant vulgar to salting ham. The cult can not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful of the Old courageous people settled in the catacombs and enlarged gradually.\nThe underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an act of faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should attempt to venture without a plan).\nOnce the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupant. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, and the pure Galswintha course Clodomir.\nOne might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Prohibits burial in the crypt of the kings of the capital, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fancier one than the other (we still remember the magician Boris invert the fencing master Gunther paralytic and Ingmar lecherous Minister who obtains the favor of successive Teuderic wife and his daughter Princess Theodora)."
