Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs, it contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\\Built on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarian rule, the abbey was presented to them as an ignorant vulgar to salting ham. The cult can not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful of the Old courageous people settled in the catacombs and enlarged gradually.\\The underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an act of faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should attempt to venture without a plan).\\Once the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupant. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, and the pure Galswintha course Clodomir.\\One might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Prohibits burial in the crypt of the kings of the capital, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fancier one than the other (we still remember the magician Boris invert the fencing master Gunther paralytic and Ingmar lecherous Minister who obtains the favor of successive Teuderic wife and his daughter Princess Theodora)."
