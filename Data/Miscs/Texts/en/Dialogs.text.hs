///TUTORIAL///
Miserable fisherman!\Here you are in Limbo. You have much to do before they can hope to reach Paradise...\For you to prove to myself first and foremost that you are worthy of my trust. Some of your fellows to whom I gave a chance for redemption have not even been able to get out by themselves in this room... Fools... Show me that you're better from them!
Miserable sinner!\Here you are in Limbo. You have much to do before they can hope to reach Paradise...\For you to prove to myself first and foremost that you are worthy of my trust. Some of your fellows to whom I gave a chance for redemption have not even been able to get out by themselves in this room... Fools... Show me that you're better from them!
Fine. I would still not explain how to get through a door!\Let's see if you can beat you. It drags in the next room the soul of one of your fellows who do me any good. If I think your history of violence hast not foreign. Eliminate this creature!\\(Click on the creature to destroy it)

Perfect. You can now find the items you've collected in your inventory.\\(Click on the icon of the interface below or on "I". It is also possible to equip them by placing them in the appropriate box or placed in use with shortcuts keys 1 to 8.)
You will notice also that each destroyed enemy strengthens your soul and helps make you stronger.\\(When the bar is filled souls you win a level)
Now you have to eliminate the creatures in the next room (Do not kill, they are already dead for centuries). You will win and the strengths and talents more!
Well! You're learning fast and that's what I expected from you...\You've turned a corner, and you can now choose which area you want to improve yourself.\\(We choose the features that one wishes improve through the inventory, "I")

This will place it in the shortcut bar at the bottom. You can access it during the game with the 1-8 keys and clicking the right mouse button.)
Perfect! This test was very small but all the poor souls I've known have not succeeded, far away... Yes, I know this is appalling.\Now join the light at the back of the room and embrace your next mission.\If I had knowledge of your past I'll complain packages...

To the Abbey of St. Clodomir

////ABBE///
Hello to you my son! Is that you? Yes it can be you! Big, strong... The Savior! Out of nowhere! God spoke to me, and I knew he did not abandon us! Vas, exterminate the vermin demonic rode around everywhere!
Who are you woman? From what country do you come up with this evocative, these strange clothes? Are you a demon who was able to interfere in God's house? Pay attention to your actions, even in these troubled times we can find time to burn witches...
I recognize in you a servant of God my brother. But the fever that I read in your eyes me some concern... Are you okay?
Hello to you my son. You have to come from a country very far away to wander in such attire.\Maybe you will know how to get rid of the vermin that has befallen our poor country?
Where am I?
You're in the abbey of Saint Clodomir. By these days it is one of the few places in the country where we find some peace. And more... Even here it is woven of devilry!
Of devilry?
Yes, well, of devilry. My brother monks have a strange behavior, sometimes unhealthy, and some have mysteriously disappeared... I hear noises in the catacombs under the Abbey at night. I initially thought that wild animals that would be introduced but I do not know what to think... I'm afraid I must admit, and the only solution I found is to close the door leading to it. But he will have someone to go and see what happens there... I'm worried about my monks!
Do you want me to go?
Oh! I dared not ask... I have some qualms about sending you there alone, but we are not fighters you see... If you need help I'll do what I can! Here, take the key of the catacombs and good luck, God assist you!\Come back soon and tell me what you saw.
That's what I thought! It ran terrible things behind that door... Certainly we are surrounded by evil! He's out, it is under our feet! Is the sky itself is really kind to us poor miserable human?\Let us... It is urgent to clean our basement! We are surrounded by evil, but we can not tolerate it in the den of the Lord!\To perform purification at all costs you must find the relics of four saints who are dispersed in the catacombs.
Finally, you found the source of evil! Here I am reassured, but not that much... The whole world seems overrun by this disgusting filth of undead and mysteriously animated objects... I think the end of this chaotic period is still far alas!
I am looking for weapons.
You can ask Rognorak, our blacksmith who has taken refuge with us in this holy place. That's a big guy friendly, he continues to forge weapons even if it no longer serves to nothing, he says it occupies until the end of the world.
Do you have things to sell?
Could you bless something?
Goodbye!
Ah! Our hero!
You're back, woman?
I saw skeletons in the catacombs!
I got relic.
Perfect! You quickly, I did not even think you could do it to be honest...\Now go see the lesser brother next to me, he will accompany you to pronounce the mantra in the Oculus. Follow him and make sure it reaches the Oculus safe and sound!
The brother was murdered by Hergahrt, a demonic priest!
Hergahrt, the former priest of the Church of Saint Waldinghe! My God... I did never hear from him... We have banned years ago for his behavior intolerable. With a neighboring parish priest named Johannes they spent their time drinking and laughing in public the result of confessions they received. Not to mention everything we could agree on their differences with women...\I think Hergahrt went much further now. It is the henchman of the ignominy that is sweeping Ruhigland.\I am sure there is land in the crypt of his former church, which communicates with our catacombs... Well, here's the key to the gate that separates our catacombs in the crypt.\Hergahrt must be eliminated, it is now an enemy of the Church and of the human race!
Of course! The blessing increases the virtues of weapons and armor. So I can give my blessing I need some holy water, and to sing a litany of course object to bless!
Let's go!
And then?
Then he'll have to escort a minor brother to deliver a litany in the Oculus, the old ceremonial hall of the first Christians. You will recognize, is the largest room of the catacombs and the outside light gives it.\For now fetches the relics! It's been a long time that nobody went to see them and we lost the plans of the catacombs...\You'll find the Holy Frenegonde ear, the heart of St. Joachim, St. Galswintha eyes and the finger of St. Clodomir. Good luck!




///FARMER///
Hey! What are you doing man? You look like a stranger but you're saying so well built! You would not get a service?
Hello madmoizelle! Let me guess: you are going from the city right? Because i do not like rags now... If you know a beefy guy I would need a service for get me back to my farm.
Who are you?
I'm Borlor, of the southern farm. Many farmers to feed this beautiful world that is anything but pray. Moreover c'qui seen falling on our face because there is not pray out loud...\Finally you have not criticize because chui virtually refugee... Besides I need a service, remember?
What service?
In fact there are plenty of funny creatures everywhere at the moment, as you have noticed as well. Well they are not ben solid, often a good sod between the eyes and talk about it more!\But there are things tougher, the kinds of living stones! I saw with my own eyes! They look like regular rocks from afar but it will move and attack you if you approach. I can not drive them more and I can go home! Want to see what you can do? I give a bottle of liquor turnip my personal cuy who chase these bastards from my house!
I'll see what I can do...
Frankly I have better things to do than take care of the wall of a peasant!
Thank you so much! I hope I can trust you! Ten, that's a little turnip of my liquor. It's hard but it gives energy, with it you can not plow horse!
Goodbye!
Great! Follow the path that goes south and you will find my farm at roadside. You will recognize the monsters who will jump on you!
///ROMULUS TRADER///
Hello my fine fellow! Would you need anything? I sell everything but sacred objects - out of respect for the Father - and weapons - since Rognorak threatened me with an ax me to swallow.
Hello miss! You might want to buy something? I have no perfumes or makeup in stock but maybe you'll be interested in something else?
Good God, you make a head! You should offer a small gift to cheer you up! I have a lot of niceties that I give you at a friendly price!
Hi guy! You know I like your quickdraw? This is not the conventional home but need to know innovate, eh? I'll want a lot of things ES-SEN-TI-AL to sell you. I say "sell" but that's the principle, in fact it is almost set!
Who are you?
My name is Romulus and I am a merchant. Normally I was going to Nekhag, not far from a corn Flatagahn. A friendly city, unpretentious. In short I went there, just to get some rest, but I had the bad idea to spend in this unfortunate country. I ran things for the bizarre, such as stones moving or animated skeletons... I got scared and when I saw the abbey in the distance I abandoned my cart to rush into this holy place. At least for now it survives without undergoing these visions of horror and chaos!
And your cart?
Well it should always be there, somewhere south of here. Unless the bone puppets have chosen to play with... I would love to get something! Just a little bag of tobacco from Mad-Retsam. It would help me pass the time, we are so bored here...\If you bring it back to me I'll give a you little, with a small purse too!\It would make me so happy!
I am looking for weapons.
Must ask Rognorak, the guy not comfortable there. He forbade me to sell arms on pain of death. As if the external threats were not enough! Talk about a shopping...
Got the deal?
I have your tobacco!
Ahhh! In my arms my friend! My good tobacco! Hey, for the trouble I give you a little as promised! Using it in moderation, it is strong enough and its effects are unpredictable. You have there for about ten takes. Thank you again, with this book I will not see spending the next week!
Goodbye!
Pfffff... What nice dog!




///ROGNORAK BLACKSMITH///
Yeah? What do you want abroad? A weapon, armor, tools? Times are troubled but life goes on, as they say!
Well chick! You're up awfully! If you need a service would ask Rognorak! He always knows to please the ladies... Rognorak
Frankly it's not lack of men in dress here... We'll end up talking my man! And I only sell things that are bad for the health of souls.
Hi there! You too have decided to disguise yourself to celebrate the end of the world? When I see spend all that happening right now I think we need a clean sweep and start all over again. I do not like your clothes and your upper air but if it is to kill the unspeakable horrors lurking around I'll sell you what you want!
Who are you?
I'm Rognorak, former blacksmith of the Empire. I like to forge weapons quietly in my corner but a fight that's not really my cup of tea. I am an artist! So when they decided to send me to the front to forge swords to chain I cut and I left to chance...\I do not know if it was a good idea to think... I could not stand to be just a few kilometers from the horde of monsters and now I have to survive a few yards away, taking refuge in that damn Abbey!
Where are we?
You're not very observant boy! We see in a monastery! Or an abbey, I've never understood the difference... Question dresses were what level must be female but it is a little sad!
You're not very observant sweetie! Most often men dress like this are found in the monasteries. Well sometimes we also unearthed in the brothels, huh, hey hey!
We trade?
You can do something for me?
Goodbye!
So, what's up my man?
So miss, we come back to see the blacksmith? We do not shy, eh, heh heh...
RETURN INQUISITOR
RETURN PISTOLERO
What are you doing?
There? Immediately? But I'm bored! That is, perfectly, I'm bored to the point where it could go bad... You know what? I am so idle that if you give me something to tinker with a gun I'll make the free, just for fun. \If you want I have an old plan that I train sword for ages. Find me three pounds of metal and I will forge a wink. It will always be better than the usual junk that sells Romulus. Finally he sold before I blast him in the bronchi! Ha ha ha!
There? Immediately? But I'm bored! That is, perfectly, I'm bored to the point where it could go bad... You know what? I am so idle that if you give me something to tinker with a gun I'll make the free, just for fun. \If you want I plan a sophisticated machine that I train for ages. Find me a pound of metal and a solid piece of wood and I'll factory in stride. It is a gift, because I love the pretty girls!





///BARKEEPER////
Pssst! Hey you!
Pssst! Hey you! Come help me!\I dare not leave my hostel since these demons attacked me!
I'll get rid of right away!
Wait, I have other details to be worked before...
Hey! I still need you! Help me, I can not stand to stay locked up here!
Thank you, I do not know where to go but at least I'm going to run away from here!
You hear a howl of pain in the distance... Looks like the voice of the innkeeper...



///SERGEANT WALDEMAR////
Greetings my guys. You are here safe because me and my men are guarding the place. If you go by and you find survivors sends us, we represent the last vestiges of civilization!
Greetings, female. I have nothing against you but avoids dispel my men, they need all their concentration to keep the walls of the Abbey...
Who are you?
I'm Waldemar, Sub-Officer of the Empire. Normally I'm Sergeant but given the circumstances I might as well be Marshall! All these skeletons almost make me regret the barbarians. At least they were flesh and blood like us and killing made sense...
I can do something for you?
Well no, not now. These horrible creatures seem to ignore the abbey for now... I hope it will last because if they decide to storm it will not stand for long. At least Will is the consolation of dying all together!
Goodbye!
What is happening?
Ah! What a question! Well I can not answer you specifically. Everything seems to be Ruhigland suddenly invaded by hostile creatures, corpses and skeletons strangely resuscitated... Some point to a bloodthirsty creature that walks the night, nicknamed the "reaper", others talk of a monstrosity in the eyes that shine like fire in the forest... Going to sort out the fantasies of these bumpkins and reality!\In any case many of us think that all this has something to do with a barbarian revenge...
Was he outside of the survivors of the abbey?
Some... The old Ridwen Myrta and her niece who live in the woods to the south, the innkeeper of the Wolf peeled who has cut his home, and Jacquou, the poor fool who walks around the village. He is not afraid of him anything! He wanders the night with strange small bright objects. I wonder how he manages to survive amidst all that, but he refuses to come with us!








///FARMER SUITE///
Beware the reaper!
The reaper?
Yeah, the reaper! You know? This is kind of lanky beast with a head! The horrible is the reaper! And terrible, nobody can kill him, ten peasants died with their fork while trying to zigouiller. Y comes out at night, then must be locked at night. The day never seen!


///DOORS///
It's locked.
It's closed.

//MISSED RELIC///
The reliquary of St. Galswintha is empty!


///MONK ALCUIN///
Hello! I am brother Alcuin. I am the second brother of the abbey, although Hademar consider myself his slave...
What can you tell me about the abbey?
The abbey of Saint Clodomir is a venerable institution known throughout Ruhigland. As you can see it now serves as a refuge for neighbors who escape the horror that fell on us...
Goodbye!
What do you know about relics?
The relics are treasures that ensure the reputation of the abbey. Specifically they are useless, except to perform miraculous incantations once a century... And yet these incantations do not always work!\Since monks were lost in the catacombs we banned their access, and Hademar no one cares much. I'm sure he does not even know that relics disappeared...
It lacks a relic?
Yes, before Hademar happens, the monks indulged in questionable practices. Some farmers were paid to show them the relics... And one day one of them, the pair of eyes of St. Galswintha, disappeared due to the negligence of a brother...
Where can I find it?
Hm... I do not know. Some pointed to a thief, other animal that would have won the thing... I do not know what is the exact reality about this unfortunate event! Yet there is something that should simplify searching: the eyes have the ability to glow in the dark. If it's any help...







///TEUDERIC///
Forgotten by all the gods... a human being, a real, flesh!\I did not see one day...\Help me to die! I want to go to my grave and find rest but I can not do it alone!
I'm Teuderic, King of the Old People. Not the brightest for sure, I was duped and betrayed by a bunch of mediocre courtiers. When I realized their treachery I have them all hanged. But since my death their ghosts haunt me incessantly, and it's been ages since I experienced this hellish existence without hope of rest. Only a living can get rid of it!
Who are you?
Meurs, skeletal abomination!
For now I have something else to do...
How can I help you?
It's simple. Wait a few moments and they will come back. Gunther, Ingmar, Boris and others, these vile pigs! I am powerless against them but you will be able to defeat them. Or perish by the way, I must warn you they are more powerful dead than they were alive!
Okay.
In this case I'm going!
At the enemy!
You'll die, vermin!
Finally... freedom...
///Johannes///
Forgiveness young person, but this relic comes back to me! I was just going to take it when you arrived! Hi hi!
Go, my dear, you take care of our valiant heroes!
Go, my dear, you take care of that little idiot!
Idiot, you'll run out to follow me...
Go a little exercise!
From Johannes!
It's time that I make you suffer... personally!
