///TUTORIAL///
Miserable fisherman!\Here you are in Limbo. You have much to do before you can hope to reach Paradise...\You should prove to myself that you are worthy of my trust. Some of your fellows to whom I gave a chance for redemption wasn't even able to get out by themselves from this room... Fools... Show me that you're better from them!
Miserable sinner!\Here you are in Limbo. You have much to do before you can hope to reach Paradise...\You should prove to myself that you are worthy of my trust. Some of your fellows to whom I gave a chance for redemption wasn't even able to get out by themselves from this room... Fools... Show me that you're better from them!
Fine. I will still not explain how to get through a door!\Let's see if you can beat it. It leads to the next room to the soul of one of your fellows who didn't do me any good. The history of violence is not foreign for you. Eliminate this creature!\\(Click on the creature to destroy it)
Not bad! I would now like you to confront many of these stupid creatures who keep safe. Look at them... They do not know why they are kept, or even what's inside... If you do not want to end up like they than take it!\\ (Click to open the chest, Alt to see the objects and click on their name to pick them up)
Hold down Alt and click on the name of the object to pick it up.
Perfect. You can now find the items you've collected in your inventory.\\(Click on the icon of the interface below or on "I". It is also possible to equip them by placing them in the appropriate box or use them with shortcut keys from 1 to 8.)
You will notice also that each destroyed enemy strengthens your soul and helps make you stronger.\\(When the bar is filled with souls you get new level)
Now you have to eliminate the creatures in the next room (Do not kill, they are already dead for centuries). You will win more strengths and talents!
Well! You're learning fast and that's what I expected from you...\You've turned a corner, and you can now choose in which area you want to improve yourself.\\(We choose the features that we wish to improve through the inventory, "I")
-Your strength increases your melee damage and allows you to wear heavier equipment.\-Dexterity allows you to dodge better and carry more items.\-Vitality increases your life.\-Your piety is your ability to invoke your god, it allows you to run more miracles (we'll come back...).\-Your charisma affects the price of objects and allows you to wear certain items.
You must know that your current status allows you to access certain powers.\You can now call upon your god to destroy your opponents.\\(Click on the icon shaped like a cross to open the panel of miracles. You can choose the way in which you want to specialize by clicking on one of three tabs at the top. You just have to right click on a miracle to learn or improve it. This will place it in the shortcut bar at the bottom. You can access it during the game with the 1-8 keys and by clicking the right mouse button.)
Perfect! This test was very small but all the poor souls I've known have not succeeded, far away... Yes, I know this is appalling.\Now join the light at the back of the room and embrace your next mission.\If I had knowledge of your past I would complain about that...
Continue
To the Abbey of St. Clodomir

////ABBE///
Hello to you my son! Is that you? Yes it can be you! Big, strong... The Savior! Out from nowhere! God spoke to me, and I knew he did not abandon us! Go, exterminate the vermin demonic creatures around everywhere!
Who are you woman? From what country do you come up with this evocative, these strange clothes? Are you a demon who was able to interfere to God's house? Pay attention to your actions, even in these troubled times we can find time to burn witches...
I recognize in you a servant of God my brother. But the fever that I read in your eyes makes me to concern... Are you okay?
Hello to you my son. You have to come from a country very far away from here to wander in such attire.\Maybe you will know how to get rid of the vermin that has befallen our poor country?
Where am I?
You're in the abbey of Saint Clodomir. By these days it is one of few places in the country where we find some peace. And more... Even here it is woven of devilry!
Of devilry?
Yes, well, of devilry. My brothers monks have a strange behavior, sometimes unhealthy, and some have mysteriously disappeared... I hear noises in the catacombs under the Abbey at night. I initially thought that there are some wild animals but I do not know what to think... I'm afraid I must admit, and the only solution I found is to close the door leading to it. But we need someone to go and see what happens there... I'm worried about my monks!
Do you want me to go?
Oh! I dare not ask... I have some qualms about sending you there alone, but we are not fighters you see... If you need help I'll do what I can! Here, take the key of the catacombs and good luck, God assist you!\Come back as soon as possible and tell me what you saw.
That's what I thought! Terrible things are going on behind that door... Certainly we are surrounded by evil! He's out, it is under our feet! Is the sky itself really kind to us poor miserable humans?\Let us... It is urgent to clean our basement! We are surrounded by evil, but we can not tolerate it in the den of the Lord!\To perform purification at all costs you must find the relics of four saints who are dispersed in the catacombs.
Finally, you found the source of evil! Here I am reassured, but not that much... The whole world seems overrun by this disgusting filth of undead and mysteriously animated objects... I think the end of this chaotic period is still far alas!
I am looking for weapons.
You can ask Rognorak, our blacksmith who has taken refuge with us in this holy place. He is a big and friendly guy, he continues to forge weapons even if it no longer serves to anyone, he says he will be occupied until the end of the world.
Do you have things to sell?
Could you bless something?
Goodbye!
Ah! Our hero!
You're back, woman?
I saw skeletons in the catacombs!
I got the relic.
Perfect! You quickly, I did not even think you could do it to be honest...\Now go see the lesser brother next to me, he will accompany you to pronounce the mantra in the Oculus. Follow him and make sure he will reach the Oculus safe and sound!
The brother was murdered by Hergahrt, a demonic priest!
Hergahrt, the former priest of the Church of Saint Waldinghe! My God... I did never hear from him... We have banned him years ago for his intolerable behavior. With a neighboring parish priest named Johannes they spent their time drinking and laughing in public the result of confessions they received. Not to mention everything we could agree on their differences with women...\I think Hergahrt went much further now. He is the henchman of the ignominy that is sweeping Ruhigland.\I am sure there is land in the crypt of his former church, which communicates with our catacombs... Well, here's the key to the gate that separates our catacombs in the crypt.\Hergahrt must be eliminated, he is now an enemy of the Church and of the human race!
Of course! The blessing increases the virtues of weapons and armor. So I can give my blessing. I need some holy water, and of course a sing on litany to bless object!
Let's go!
And then?
Then you'll have to escort a minor brother to deliver a litany in the Oculus, the old ceremonial hall of the first Christians. You will recognize, it's the largest room of the catacombs and the outside light comes inside.\For now fetch the relics! It's been a long time that nobody went to see them and we lost the plans of the catacombs...\You'll find the Holy Frenegonde ear, the heart of St. Joachim, St. Galswintha eyes and the finger of St. Clodomir. Good luck!




///FARMER///
Hey! What are you doing man? You look like a stranger but you're saying so well built! Wouldn't you make me a service?
Hello madmoizelle! Let me guess: you are going from the city, right? Because i do not like rags... If you know a beefy guy I would need a service for get me back to my farm.
Who are you?
I'm Borlor, of the southern farm. Many farmers that feed this beautiful world can't do nothing but pray. Moreover you can see falling on our face because we can not pray out loud...\Finally you should not criticize us because we became virtually refugee... Besides that I need a service, remember?
What service?
In fact there are plenty of funny creatures everywhere at the moment, as you have noticed as well. Well they are not much solid, often as a good sod between the eyes and we talk about them a lot!\But there are things tougher, the kinds of living stones! I saw with my own eyes! They look like regular rocks from afar but it will move and attack you if you approach. I can not drive them and I want to get back home! Want to see what you can do? I give a bottle of my personal turnip liquor to guy who will chase these bastards from my house!
I'll see what I can do...
Frankly I have better things to do than take care of the wall of a peasant!
Thank you so much! I hope I can trust you! Here, that's a little of my turnip liquor. It's hard but it gives energy, with it you can not plow horse!
Goodbye!
Great! Follow the path that goes south and you will find my farm at roadside. You will recognize the monsters who will jump on you!
///ROMULUS TRADER///
Hello my fine fellow! Would you need anything? I sell everything but sacred objects - out of respect for the Father - and weapons - since Rognorak threatened me with an axe.
Hello miss! You might want to buy something? I have no perfumes or makeup in stock but maybe you'll be interested in something else?
Good God, make a head up! You should offer a small gift to cheer you up! I have a lot of niceties that I will give you at a friendly price!
Hi guy! You know I like your quickdraw? This is not the conventional home but innovates, eh? I have a lot of ES-SEN-TI-AL things to sell you. I say "sell" but that's the principle, in fact it is almost free!
Who are you?
My name is Romulus and I am a merchant. Normally I was going to Nekhag, not far from a Flatagahn. A friendly city, unpretentious. In short I went there, just to get some rest, but I had the bad idea to go through this unfortunate country. I saw bizarre things, such as moving stones or animated skeletons... I got scared and when I saw the abbey in the distance I abandoned my cart to rush into this holy place. At least for now it survives without undergoing these visions of horror and chaos!
And your cart?
Well it should always be there, somewhere south from here. Unless the bone puppets have chosen to play with it... I would like to get something! Just a little bag of tobacco from Mad-Retsam. It would help me pass the time, we are so bored here...\If you bring it back to me I'll give a you little, with a small purse too!\It would make me so happy!
I am looking for weapons.
You must ask Rognorak, the guy not comfortable there. He forbade me to sell arms on pain of death. As if the external threats were not enough! Talking about shopping...
Have something to sell?
I have your tobacco!
Ahhh! In my arms my friend! My good tobacco! Hey, for the trouble I give you a little as promised! Use it in moderation, it is strong enough and its effects are unpredictable. You have there for about ten takes. Thank you again, with this thing I will be not bored spending the next week!
Goodbye!
Pfffff... What nice dog!




///ROGNORAK BLACKSMITH///
Yeah? What do you want? A weapon, armor, tools? Times are troubled but life goes on, as they say!
Well chick! You're so pretty! If you need a service go ask Rognorak! He always knows how to please the ladies... Rognorak
Frankly it's not lack of men in dress here... We'll end up talking my man! And I only sell things that are bad for the health of soul.
Hi there! You have decided to disguise yourself to celebrate the end of the world too? When I see all that happening right now around I think we need a clean sweep and start all over again. I do not like your clothes and your upper air but if it will kill the unspeakable horrors lurking around I'll sell you what you want!
Who are you?
I'm Rognorak, former blacksmith of the Empire. I like to forge weapons quietly in my corner but the fight is not really my cup of tea. I am an artist! So when they decided to send me to the front to forge swords I cut...\I do not know if it was a good idea... I could not stand just for few kilometers from the horde of monsters and now I have to survive a few yards away, taking refuge in that damn Abbey!
Where are we?
You're not very observant boy! We are in a monastery! Or an abbey, I've never understood the difference... Question about what level must be female dresses has no sense here, and it is a little sad!
You're not very observant sweetie! Most often men dress like this are found in the monasteries. Well sometimes also in the brothels, huh, hey hey!
Want to trade?
Could you do something for me?
Goodbye!
So, what's up, man?
So miss, we come back to see the blacksmith? We do not shy, eh, heh heh...
RETURN INQUISITOR
RETURN PISTOLERO
What are you doing?
There? Immediately? But I'm bored! That is, perfectly, I'm bored to the point where it could not go worse... You know what? I am so idle that if you give me something to tinker with I'll make it for free, just for fun. \If you want I have an old plan that I train sword for ages. Find me three pounds of metal and I will forge with wink. It will always be better than the usual junk that sells Romulus. Finally he sold before I blasted him in the bronchi! Ha ha ha!
There? Immediately? But I'm bored! That is, perfectly, I'm bored to the point where it could not go worse... You know what? I am so idle that if you give me something to tinker with I'll make it for free, just for fun. \If you want I have a plan of sophisticated machine that I train for ages. Find me a pound of metal and a solid piece of wood and I'll factory in stride. It is a gift, because I love pretty girls!





///BARKEEPER////
Pssst! Hey you!
Pssst! Hey you! Come help me!\I dare not leave my hostel since these demons attacked me!
I'll get rid of them right now!
Wait, I have other things to be made before...
Hey! I still need you! Help me, I can not stay locked up here!
Thank you, I do not know where to go but at least I'm going to run away from here!
You hear a howl of pain in the distance... Looks like the voice of the innkeeper...



///SERGEANT WALDEMAR////
Greetings my guy. You are here safe because me and my men are guarding the place. If you go by and you will not find survivors, we represent the last vestiges of civilization!
Greetings, female. I have nothing against you but avoid dispel my men, they need all their concentration to keep the walls of the Abbey safe...
Who are you?
I'm Waldemar, Sub-Officer of the Empire. Normally I'm Sergeant but given the circumstances I might as well be Marshall! All these skeletons almost make me regret the barbarians. At least they were flesh and blood like us and killing made sense...
Can i do something for you?
Well no, not now. These horrible creatures seem to ignore the abbey for now... I hope it will last because if they decide to storm it will not stand for long. At least we have the consolation of dying all together!
Goodbye!
What is happening?
Ah! What a question! Well I can not answer you specifically. Everything seems to be that Ruhigland was suddenly invaded by hostile creatures, corpses and skeletons strangely resuscitated... Some point to a bloodthirsty creature that walks at night, nicknamed the "reaper", others talk of a monstrosity with the eyes that shine like fire in the forest... Going to sort out the fantasies and reality of these bumpkins!\In any case many of us think that all this has something to do with a barbarian revenge...
Is there someone of the survivors outside the abbey?
Some... The old Ridwen Myrta and her niece who live in the woods to the south, the innkeeper of the Wolf who has cut his home, and Jacob, the poor fool who walks around the village. He is not afraid anything! He wanders in the night with strange small bright objects. I wonder how he manages to survive amidst all that, but he refuses to come with us!








///FARMER SUITE///
Beware the reaper!
The reaper?
Yeah, the reaper! You know? This is kind of lanky beast with a head! The reaper is horrible! And terrible, nobody can kill him, ten peasants died with their forks while trying to kill him. He comes out at night, therefore must be killed at night. He was never seen by day!


///DOORS///
It's locked.
It's closed.

//MISSED RELIC///
The reliquary of St. Galswintha is empty!


///MONK ALCUIN///
Hello! I am brother Alcuin. I am the second brother of the abbey, although Hademar considers me as his slave...
What can you tell me about the abbey?
The abbey of Saint Clodomir is a venerable institution known throughout Ruhigland. As you can see it now serves as a refuge for neighbors who escape the horror that fell on us...
Goodbye!
What do you know about relics?
The relics are treasures that ensure the reputation of the abbey. Specifically they are useless, except to perform miraculous incantations once a century... And yet these incantations do not always work!\Since monks were lost in the catacombs we banned their access, and Hademar don't cares much. I'm sure he does not even know that relic disappeared...
It lacks a relic?
Yes, before Hademar came, the monks indulged in questionable practices. Some farmers have paid to show them the relics... And one day one of them, the pair of eyes of St. Galswintha, disappeared due to the negligence of a brother...
Where can I find it?
Hm... I do not know. Some pointed to a thief, other to an animal that would have won the thing... I do not know what is the exact reality about this unfortunate event! But there is something that should simplify searching: the eyes have the ability to glow in the dark. If this could help...







///TEUDERIC///
Forgotten by all the gods... a human being, real, flesh!\I did not see one for...\Help me to die! I want to go to my grave and find rest but I can not do this alone!
I'm Teuderic, King of the Old People. Not the brightest for sure, I was duped and betrayed by a bunch of mediocre courtiers. When I realized their treachery I have hanged them all. But since my death their ghosts haunt me incessantly, and it's been ages since I experiencing this hellish existence without hope of rest. Only a living can get me rid of it!
Who are you?
Pfff, skeletal abomination!
For now I have something else to do...
How can I help you?
It's simple. Wait a few moments and they will come back. Gunther, Ingmar, Boris and others, these vile pigs! I am powerless against them but you will be able to defeat them. Or perish by the way, I must warn you they are more powerful dead than they were alive!
Okay.
In this case I'm going away!
At the enemy!
You'll die, vermin!
Finally... freedom...
///Johannes///
Forgive me young person, but this relic comes back to me! I was just going to take it when you arrived! Hi hi!
Go, my dear, take care of our valiant hero!
Go, my dear, take care of that little idiot!
Idiot, you'll run to follow me...
Go a little exercise!
From Johannes!
It's time when I'll make you suffer... personally!




///CRUCIFY///
*Hé... Toi là ! Viens ici... 
*J'ai besoin de toi !
*Un squelette qui parle ? 
*Je ne suis pas un squelette, je suis un homme dépourvu de chair.
*Tu désirais me faire part d'une de tes pensées ? 
*Je commence à en avoir assez de cette situation. Ca fait des semaines que j'attends de l'aide.
*Quelle aide ?
*J'étais un crucifié comme les autres, mais j'ai eu le malheur de croiser Ridwen, la nièce de Myrta. Disons qu'on avait un petit différent d'ordre sentimental qui la tiraillait, et quand elle m'a vu, la garce m'a jeté un sort. Un sort pourri qui prolonge la vie de l'âme mais pas celle du corps. Tu vois le genre ?
*Pas exactement... 
*Et bien je me suis vu et senti pourrir progressivement, jusqu'à ne plus être qu'un tas d'os. Maintenant que j'ai bien profité de cette expérience délicieuse j'aimerais assez que cela cesse. 
*Allez, sois concret.
*Va voir Ridwen, ou Myrta, et dis leur que je souffre le martyre. Implore leur pitié, qu'elles me délivrent de cet état pathétique. Je ne demande qu'une chose : la mort, enfin. Tu trouveras ces deux furies  vers l'ouest, au nord du hameau, en rentrant dans la forêt au niveau des deux tas de pierre...
*Je vais voir ce que je peux faire.
*Ton cas ne m'intéresse pas. 
*Du neuf ?
*Non, pas encore.
*Je n'ai guère pu discuter avec tes amies... L'une avait disparu et l'autre s'est jetée sur moi pour me tuer.
*Ca ne m'étonne pas, elles sont complètement timbrées. Tu as pu malgré tout apprendre comment m'aider ?
*Oui, il faut que je te fasse brûler. 
*Il ne te reste plus qu'à chercher du bois alors... 5 planches devraient suffirent... Je t'en prie, aide moi !
*Non, hélas je l'ignore...
*Non... Non ! Ne me laisse pas ! Nooooooooooon !
**Faire brûler le crucifié*
*Vas-y, fais moi brûler, que je disparaisse enfin pour de bon... Aaaaaaaah ! Je quitte ce monde de douleur ! Merci !





///RIDWEN THE WITCH///
*Oh, un bel homme... Et vivant de surcroît ! 
*Salut jeune fille. Si tu cherches des hommes par ici tu perds ton temps. 
*Je cherche Jacquou, un simple d'esprit. Vous le connaissez ?
*Oh oui, c'est un brave garçon. Un garçon délicieux même, mais je ne l'ai pas vu depuis un bout de temps.
*Vous êtes bien sûre de ne pas avoir vu Jacquou dernièrement ? Je me demande si sa disparition n'est pas liée à l'apparition du faucheur...
*Mais c'est qu'il en sait des choses le bougre ! On lit des livres, paysan ? Alors tu le sais, que je l'ai bouffé ton Jacquou !  On aurait dit un porc : une panse énorme et une cervelle comme un abricot !\Allez, viens là, je vais t'apprendre encore bien des choses...
*Mais mademoiselle est instruite ! On vous fait la lecture au bordel ? Je l'ai bouffé ton Jacquou !  On aurait dit un porc : une panse énorme et une cervelle comme un abricot !
*Je cherche les yeux de sainte Galswinthe, vous n'en auriez pas entendu parler ?
*Les yeux d'une sainte ? Non, je ne m'intéresse pas à ces choses là... Les bondieuseries très peu pour moi...
*Vous connaissez le faucheur ?
*Le Faucheur ? Je ne l'ai jamais vu, mais je sais qu'il fait très peur aux paysans. Mais les paysans ont peur de tout : le feu, la foudre... La peur nait de l'ignorance n'est-ce pas ?
*Je sais que vous avez créé le Faucheur, sorcière !
*Mais oui, imbécile, c'est bien moi qui l'ai fait, je sentais que la Terre voulait le faire naître, j'ai senti les contractions maléfiques ! Il me fallait une sorcière et un simplet pour le créer... J'ai dû les manger, et de leur digestion est né le Faucheur ! Maintenant, meurs !
*J'ai croisé un pauvre supplicié sur une croix. Il implore votre clémence.
*Qu'il implore, puisqu'il n'a rien d'autre à faire ! Il mérite de souffrir encore un bon moment.
*Meurs, abomination !



///CAPORAL///
*Salut femelle ! Ici on accepte que les couillus, les burnés, ceux qu'en ont dans les braies ! C'est l'enfer venu sur Terre ! 
*Qui es-tu ?
*Je suis le commandant de la tour. Waldemar nous a envoyé ici pour se débarrasser de nous... Pardon, je veux dire pour surveiller la route ! Je suis flanqué de nos deux éléments d'élite : un qui a failli mourir en chargeant une arquebuse et un autre qui a peur du noir...
*C'est donc vous l'avant-poste installé par Waldemar ? 
*Ah ! Ah ! Installé par Waldemar ? Non, on a fait ça tous seuls. Waldemar ne risque rien, il a les miches bien planquées dans l'abbaye. S'il se les fait attaquer ce sera par un moine ! Remarque il lui faudrait peut-être un garde du corps, un moine décidé ça peut faire mal !
*Vous ne semblez pas avoir le sens de la hiérarchie...
*Oh que si. Si je ne l'avais pas, je serais déjà à la place de Waldemar...
*Vous avez vu le faucheur ?
*Le faucheur, le faucheur, la faucheuse oui ! Cette saleté est une femelle qui pond des œufs, on en a trouvé dans son ancien repère. Quand on l'entend approcher je peux te dire qu'on fiche le camp, ce machin est aussi laid qu'énorme !
*Vous n'auriez pas vu un simple d'esprit ?
*Oui, il y a quelques jours... Il se trimballait avec des drôles de choses brillantes. On a essayé de le raisonner mais il courrait dans tous les sens comme un canard sans tête. Ca fait un moment qu'il n'a plus pointé le bout de son nez. Il doit être crevé par là, dans un fossé...
*Vous connaissez Myrta et Ridwen ?
*Les deux sorcières ? Ma foi je les connais de loin et ça me suffit. Trois de mes gars ont tenté de chahuter la petite, mais ils sont revenus de là-bas avec leur machin tout rétréci... Je crois qu'ils ont essuyé un vilain sort de réduction cruellement placé, si tu vois ce que je veux dire...  Si tu veux te soulager je te conseille plutôt une brebis errante, c'est moins dangereux !
