The rest is strongly condemned by a heavy door that is forbidden to touch.\\\\Tuesday, November 7:\\\\The cells arranged in order of the Father Hademar in these ancient catacombs offer an ideal place for meditation. The darkness, the silence is such that the monk is totally receptive to subtle signs of Very Large, sometimes seems someone whispers something near his ear.\\\\Friday, November 10:\\\\I must admit that sometimes my mind, in this delicious silence, seems to play tricks with me. A bit like a corpse showa in the distance, the deep silence of the cells gives rise of sound illusions, sometimes troubling when consider they emanate actually from the depths of our soul.\\\\Sunday November 13:\\\\After the celebration of the Sunday service I spent a few hours reading in the library near the catacombs. Leaving the door open because I was alone, I heard, this time I'm sure, strange and disturbing sounds, like alternating moans of expression of pain and the obscene pleasure. Believing been a subject of a joke of Lothair, a brother who loves to distract us beyond reason, I have traveled the corridor hoping to uncover him, in vain... Noises quickly stopped.\\\\Monday, November 14:\\\\I just heard strange noises again nearest to the catacombs, and now I know where they come from: the other side of the forbidden door! Certainly there are creatures on the other side. Tormented souls seeking rest, maybe even, who knows, monks who eventually lost find their way, miraculously surviving in the catacombs for years? I know that Our Almighty knows we be challenged by the most incredible wonders!\\Despite the ban of Hademar I will go there tomorrow.

At the end of his speech, he invariably threw an acorn on the ground to signify that he had finished, his every action was as a grain of wisdom designed to thrive as the venerable oak.\\With constant friendly smile on the face, He stated the justice with his sweet voice, without ever raising his voice and the good farmers - as his lords - accepted his judgment with these words again and again repeating: \"Clodomir just spoke, he raised finger, he threw the acorn. Everything is set!\".\\When the horrific hordes of barbarians with well known beastly manners befell Ruhigland, spreading desolation, Clodomir reassured his people: he will talk to these thugs as to surely lambs, because justice is born of love, and it was missing, they are auneducated and poor, need to know the revelation of the Old People to stop doing evil!\\Clodomir then crossed with his usual calm smoldering villages to talk with the barbarians. Meeting one of the leaders, named Wilankar Wurgasht, he wore a friendly smile and lifted his usual middle finger as a sign of temperance. Here! The other believed he was about to cast a spell, and his sharp sword, cutted off in a flash the finger of the holy man, then arms, and finally his head. His plan was accomplished, the bloodthirsty brute made a pendant from Clodomir's finger and gave the rest of his body and its reservation of acorns to hungry pigs, bursting into a laugh like the roar of a wild beast."

msgid "This book is an account of the inventory of the relics of the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\\\\\\\\Heart of Saint Joachim\\\\The heart of Saint Joachim was found ninety-eight years after his unfortunate death, in a bazaar. He slept in a small wooden box. At the sight at withered by years body, a particularly devout buyer felt a warmth of divine invade, and he called upon God to destroy the field where the noble body of the saint was buried. As the invoked sentence did not come, the happy man knew he was right and gave the relic to the abbey of Saint Clodomir.\\The heart of St. Joachim is still preserved at St. Clodomir. Its condition is correct.\\\\Ear of Saint Frenegonde\\\\Ear of St. Frenegonde was miraculously found one hundred twenty-seven years after her terrible ordeal. Canon Ambroisius was discovered in the stomach of a sow, which was set to make a sausages. Illuminated by divine grace, the man immediately recognized the ear as belonging to the saint.\\The ear is preserved in the catacombs of St. Clodomir, in fair condition, though somewhat dry.\\\\\\Eye of Saint Galswintha\\\\The eyes of St. Galswintha appeared in a ceremonial necklace worn by one of the last kings of barbarians Ruhigland. Struck down by a warrior, led by holy faith, abominable creature freed the precious relic which became property of the abbey.\\Galswintha's holy eyes have unfortunately left the catacombs of St. Clodomir because an unfortunate event. A monk of evil memory have judged expedient to elevate the eyes from the holy shrine for its exhibit at the sight of peasants, and the relic mysteriously disappeared. The rumor involves Katrina (suspected of witchcraft) but following deaths because sudden illness of three successive investigators recovering the relic have postponed searching.\\\\The finger of Saint Clodomir\\\\The mummified finger of Saint Clodomir was found in the loot of a barbarian king, who used it as a pen to scribble some incomprehensible gibberish. This use explains the black color of the holy body, which is otherwise in excellent condition."

msgid "To Vlanker brother, honorary monk of the abbey.\\\\As everyone knows the abbey of Saint Clodomir is considered a beacon of faith and imperial heirs of the Old People. Founded three centuries after the death of the saint whose name it bears, not far from where Clodomir was eaten by pigs. It contains many unknown treasures of ordinary mortals.\\Built on an underground necropolis forgotten at the time of barbarians rule, the abbey was presented to them as an house for salting ham. The cult could not be done within the building itself for fear of arousing the suspicion of the invaders, the faithful and courageous Old People settled in the catacombs and enlarged it gradually.\\The underground network became a well huge maze under the action of the faithful who find themselves more and more to pray. Digging became an Act of Faith, and fervor was such that under the barbarous oppression catacombs stretched themselves in colossal proportions (to the point that one should not attempt to venture without a plan).\\Once the period of barbarian rule ended, the catacombs were evacuated by the faithful and they collected the remains of countless martyrs of the occupants. Four of them were canonized because of the exemplary nature of their sacrifice: the kind Frenegonde, Joachim the shepherd, the pure Galswintha and of course Clodomir.\\One might also note the presence of the tomb of Teuderic, one of ancient kings of our people. Burial in the crypt of the kings was prohibited, as his reign was deemed pathetic, he was taken to St. Clodomir respect for the sovereign lineage. Most aware of our history know that Teuderic had indeed prevailed under the influence of advisors and dishonest fanciers (we still remember the invert magician Boris, the paralytic fencing master Gunther and lecherous Minister Ingmar who obtained the favor of Teuderic's wife and his daughter Princess Theodora)."
